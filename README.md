# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Welcome to my first Data Science project! This project was built as part of my **Data Science & AI Internship at Corizo**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the **next day's stock closing price** using historical data.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib 📈
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess stock data
2. Use Linear Regression to predict next-day prices
3. Evaluate model using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
4. Visualize actual vs predicted prices
